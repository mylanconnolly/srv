# Chat

This is an example chat server and client over TCP. It illustrates using the
`srv.Server` with outside state (clients connected to the chat server, in this
example).

This example is inspired by the chat example application in Chapter 8 of
[The Go Programming Language](http://www.gopl.io/) (an excellent book). If you
have not read it, I highly recommend doing so.
